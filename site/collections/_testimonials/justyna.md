blurb: Pepijn is a great boss. He has hugely contributed to creating a professional user research process in Voya. I couldn't be more empowered to let design thinking influence product strategy and drive my rationales. What is more, I personally experienced how smoothly Pepijn handles conflict management, and how effectively he creates space where design and development meet and cooperate.
